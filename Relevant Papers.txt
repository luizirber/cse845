            Argued that generalists can evolve in temporally-varying environments with no/little cost to generalism

        http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v80/n6/full/6883290a.html
            Found that selection acted on the mean of fitness, not the variance, and that there was little cost to being a generalist
