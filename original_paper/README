Source code in source/

The Avida source code (version 1.99) used in the experiments is
available in the source/avida/ directory.

The clustering source code is in the source/clustering directory.



Experimental Setup in exp-setup/

The experiment configuration files, sorted by experiment, are in the
exp-setup/ directory. The config/ subdirectory of each experiment
contains the files required by avida. The run_list file is a script to
run the experiments on the Beowulf cluster at the Center for Microbial
Ecology at Michigan State University.

The experiments:

calibration/
experiments to calibrate the cutoff used by the species clustering algorithm

resources/
limited resource environment experiments

resources_long_runs/
limited resource environment experiments with inflows of 10 and 0.1,
with doubled duration to look at long term trends

freq_dependent_selection/
frequency dependent selection species invasion experiments -- one
species from an ecosystem tries to invade a population of the other
species in the ecosystem

/ecosystem_invasion
invasion experiments -- specialists from inflow 100000 replicates
are competed against an ecosystem evolved at inflow 1000



Sample Data in data/

The population and phylogeny data from the inflow=1000, random
seed=101 replicate at update 400000 are provided. The
detail_pop.400000 file provides genotype information for the
population and is a standard avida output file. The
detail_pop.400000.t0 to t5 files are the detail_pop file sorted by
species. The historic_dump and detail_pop files are required by the
clustering program in source/clustering, and are also used by avida in
analyze mode to calculate phenotype (a sample analyze.cfg file is in
exp-setup/resources/config/). The frequency dependent selection and
ecosystem invasion experiments are based on this population.
