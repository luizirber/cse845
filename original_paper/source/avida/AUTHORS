from 1993-1998 primarily at the California Institute of Technology.
The work was partially funded by both the Computation and Neural Systems
department and Kellogg Radiation Lab at Caltech, and in development use
was made of computers at Kellogg Lab.

The 1.6 release series contains many improvements over earlier releases.

The core avida system was designed by Chris Adami, C. Titus Brown, and

the 1993 Caltech SURF program, and the 1993 SUNY Stony Brook URECA program.

Portions of Avida have been implemented by: Charles Ofria, Claus O. Wilke
Travis Collier, and Dennis Adler.
