To compile and install Avida, you have to do
  ./configure; make; make install

By default, you will get an optimized version of the code without
viewer. The installation goes into a directory called 'work' that 
is created in your working directory. See below how to change that.

There is a number of options you can give to configure to change the
default behavior:
  --enable-debug: Compile with debugging symbols instead of optimized.
  --enable-gnu-debug: Compile with special debugging symbols for the
           gnu debugger. Doesn't work if you are not using gcc.
  --enable-viewer: Compile with ncurses viewer. You need the ncurses
           library installed.
  --enable-profile: Compile with profiling information.
  --enable-standard-prefix: By default, the configure script that
           comes with Avida does not accept the options '--prefix', 
           '--bindir' and '--datadir'. If you give the option
           'enable-standard-prefix', however, you can use these
	   options to customize your install.
  --help: Gives you an overview over all existing options.

Hence, in order to compile with viewer and gnu debugging symbols, you
have to do
  ./configure --enable-gnu-debug --enable-viewer; make

In order to install the executable into /usr/local/bin and the
supporting files into /usr/local/share/avida, do
  ./configure --enable-standard-prefix --bindr=/usr/local/bin --datadir=/usr/loca/share/avida
If you choose this installation, you will probably want to set the
variable DEFAULT_DIR in 'defs.hh' to "/usr/local/share/avida". In that
way, the supporting files are found automatically, wherever you run avida.

If you want to install only the executable, but not the supporting
files, do 
  make install-exec
instead of 'make install'.

*Important*:
If you have already build Avida without viewer, and you want to
rebuild it with viewer, or vice versa, you have to issue a
  make viewer-clean
between the two builds. Otherwise, strange things might happen.
